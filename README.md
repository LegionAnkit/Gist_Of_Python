# Gist Of Python
Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.
<br>These are few practice programs for beginners and intermediate level focusing on few important concepts of python which are as folows:
- ### Array
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array). <br>The program contains creation and manipulation of arrays.

- ### Conditional

Conditional Statements are used to make decisions based on the conditions. Conditional statements execute sequentially when there is no condition around the statements. If you put some condition for a block of statements, the execution flow may change based on the result evaluated by the condition. This process is also called decision making.

 - ### Iteration 
 
Iteration statements repeat some processes during which some inner Statements are executed repeatedly until the Condition that limits the execution cycle becomes false or they are executed for all values of the same data type.
It is also known as looping statement. For and while loop are the two types of looping statements in Python. 

## Requirement
Any system with python interpreter(preferably 3.6 or above) and terminal.
